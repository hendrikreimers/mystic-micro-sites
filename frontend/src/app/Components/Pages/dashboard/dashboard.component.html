<h1>Welcome, Mystic Micro Site Creators!</h1>

<p>At the moment you can only create new pages, you cannot edit existing pages.</p>
<p>Once a page has been created, a unique link is provided only once.</p>
<p>If this link is lost, the page cannot be accessed again. The only way to is through the backend CLI PHP script
  using the master password.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
